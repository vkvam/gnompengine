# GnompEngine
An engine for quickly prototyping games with ECS pattern. Built on top of LibGDX, Ashley and Box2D, with all the benefits that these frameworks provides.

The idea is to have the end-user define the physical properties of- and relationship between entities through components, and let the engine deal with constructing the components that are related to gameplay, such as textures and physicsbodies.
