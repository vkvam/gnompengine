# GnompEngine
A 2D java gameengine for quickly prototyping games with Component-Entity-Systems, built on top of LibGDX, Ashley and Box2D.

The aim is to let the end-user focus on defining the gameobjects through components by physical properities such as color,density,shape and relation; and let the engine deal with translating these into low-level components such as textures and Box2D bodies.

To get started, clone the repo and run TestPlatformerLauncher.
