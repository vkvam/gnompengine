# GnompEngine
An 2D java gameengine for quickly prototyping games with Component-Entity-Systems, built on top of LibGDX, Ashley and Box2D.

The aim is to let the end-user focus on defining the gameobjects by physical properities such as color,density,shape and relation; and let the engine deal with translating that into low-level stuff, such as textures and physicsbodies.

To get started, clone/fork the repo and run TestPlatformerLauncher.

"Helloworld" to come...
