# GnompEngine
An engine for quickly prototyping games with Component-Entity-Systems, built on top of LibGDX, Ashley and Box2D.

The aim is to focus on defining the properties of- and relationship between gameobjects related to gameplay, and let the engine deal with the rest, such as constructing textures and physicsbodies.

To get started, clone/fork the repo and run TestPlatformerLauncher.

"Helloworld" to come...
