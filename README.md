# GnompEngine
An engine for quickly prototyping games with Component-Entity-Systems. Built on top of LibGDX, Ashley and Box2D.

The idea is to have the end-user define the physical properties of- and relationship between entities through components, and let the engine deal with constructing the components that are related to gameplay, such as textures and physicsbodies.

To get started, clone/fork the repo and run TestPlatformerLauncher.
