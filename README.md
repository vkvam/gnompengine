# GnompEngine
An 2D java gameengine for quickly prototyping games with Component-Entity-Systems built on top of LibGDX, Ashley and Box2D.

The aim is to let the end-user focus on defining the properties of gameobjects, through entity and components, that are either absolutely necessary or related to gameplay.

The engine should deal with all the low-level stuff; such as constructing textures and physicsbodies.

To get started, clone/fork the repo and run TestPlatformerLauncher.

"Helloworld" to come...
